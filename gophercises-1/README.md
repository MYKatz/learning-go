This is a golang quiz, the first project of the gophercises series by Jon Calhoun. See: https://gophercises.com/exercises/quiz

As this is my first go project, much of the programming was done alongside the tutorial. However, I implemented the bonus exercises myself:

1. Add string trimming and cleanup to help ensure that correct answers with extra whitespace, capitalization, etc are not considered incorrect.
2. Add an option (a new flag) to shuffle the quiz order each time it is run.
